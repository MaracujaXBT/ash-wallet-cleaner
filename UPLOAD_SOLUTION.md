# ASH - GitHub Upload Solution

## ðŸš¨ **Problem: GitHub Web Interface Can't Upload Folders**

GitHub's web interface only allows file uploads, not folders. But our critical files are in the `src/` folder.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Solution Options:**

### **Option 1: Use GitHub Desktop (Recommended)**
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Install and sign in with GitHub
3. Clone your repository locally
4. Copy ALL files from `C:\ash-wallet-cleaner\` to your cloned repo folder
5. GitHub Desktop will detect the folder structure
6. Commit and push to GitHub

### **Option 2: Use Git Command Line**
```bash
cd C:\ash-wallet-cleaner
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial ASH setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ash-wallet-cleaner.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **Option 3: Create Files Manually on GitHub**
1. Create repository on GitHub
2. Create `src` folder by uploading a dummy file first
3. Upload files one by one in correct folders
4. This is tedious but works

### **Option 4: Use VS Code with Git Extension**
1. Install VS Code
2. Install Git extension
3. Open `C:\ash-wallet-cleaner\` in VS Code
4. Use built-in Git to push to GitHub

## ðŸš€ **Recommended: GitHub Desktop**

This is the easiest way to upload the entire project with folder structure intact.

### **Steps:**
1. **Download GitHub Desktop**: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. **Install and sign in**
3. **Create repository** on GitHub first
4. **Clone repository** in GitHub Desktop
5. **Copy all files** from `C:\ash-wallet-cleaner\` to your cloned folder
6. **Commit and push**
