# ASH - Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ **Fixed Issues:**

### **1. TypeScript Errors (FIXED)**
- ❌ `'React' is declared but its value is never read` → ✅ Removed unused React import
- ❌ `'address' is declared but its value is never read` → ✅ Removed unused address variable
- ❌ `'disconnect' is declared but its value is never read` → ✅ Removed unused disconnect import
- ❌ `'setTokens' is declared but its value is never read` → ✅ Removed unused setTokens

### **2. NPM Warnings (IGNORE)**
These are just warnings, not errors:
- `npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated @paulmillr/qr@0.2.1` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated @motionone/vue@10.16.4` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated @walletconnect/modal@2.7.0` - Normal, won't break build
- `npm warn deprecated eslint@8.57.1` - Normal, won't break build

## 🚀 **Your Deployment Should Now Work!**

### **What's Fixed:**
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Unused imports removed
- ✅ Unused variables removed
- ✅ Build should complete successfully

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Commit your changes** to GitHub
2. **Redeploy on Vercel** (it will auto-deploy from GitHub)
3. **Check your Vercel URL** - it should work now!

### **If You Still Get Errors:**

#### **Common Vercel Issues:**
1. **Build Command**: Make sure it's `npm run build`
2. **Output Directory**: Make sure it's `dist`
3. **Node Version**: Set to 18+ in Vercel settings
4. **Environment Variables**: Make sure they're set correctly

#### **Environment Variables to Set:**
```
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID = your-project-id
VITE_DEV_FEE_WALLET = 0xf2082112688b1bb19b8c8697ddae1ef68d26b1d1
VITE_HYPE_TOKEN_ADDRESS = 0x7317beb7cceed72ef0b346074cc8e7ab
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ App deploys to Vercel
- ✅ Beautiful RainbowKit wallet connection works
- ✅ HyperEVM Testnet support ready

**Your ASH app should now deploy successfully!** 🚀
